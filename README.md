This is probably a bit crazy, but this is a library with a few extension methods for building SQL crud statements (insert, update, delete), both in a "plain" and generic form. This came up in the course of working on my [BackgroundService Extensions](https://github.com/adamfoneil/BackgroundService.Extensions) project. My cronjob class inserts or updates ongoing job info [here](https://github.com/adamfoneil/BackgroundService.Extensions/blob/master/BackgroundService.Extensions/SqlServerCronJobBackgroundService.cs#L37-L43), and it was going to be a little more raw inline SQL than I wanted. My existing [Dapper.Repository](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Dapper.Repository) was not going to be a good fit for reasons I'm not positive make sense anymore.

Anyway, check the [tests](https://github.com/adamfoneil/SimpleCrud/blob/master/Testing/SqlStatements.cs) to see what this does.
